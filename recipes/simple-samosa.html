    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup oil</li>
        <li>2 small onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons coriander seed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon curry powder</li>
        <li>1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, grated</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 roma (plum) tomatoes, finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 prepared pie crusts</li>
        <li>2 egg whites, beaten, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and transfer potatoes to a bowl; coarsely mash.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir onions, coriander seed, curry powder, ginger, salt, turmeric, cumin, allspice, cayenne pepper, and cinnamon until onion is lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and stir tomatoes and peas into onion mixture; pour into mashed potatoes and thoroughly mix. Cool completely.</li>
        <li>Cut each pie crust into 8 even triangles. Spoon filling onto the wide end of each triangle; fold corners over filling creating a triangular 'hat' shape. Pinch the dough together to form a seal. Brush egg white over each samosa and arrange on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until samosas are golden brown, about 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
